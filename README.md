Surge Pricing
## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a surge pricing model by simulating pricing adjustments based on demand fluctuations. The solution uses **Kafka** and a **Spark cluster** for data aggregations.

## Features

- **Driver Position Simulator**  
  Simulates driver locations in real-time.

- **Real-time Visualization**  
  Displays driver and order positions using **ElasticSearch** and **Kibana**.
